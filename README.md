# Toolkit for the annotation of variable region of antibody (vtoolkit)

## Introduction

Vtoolkit determine variable (V) regions from query sequences firstly and then make numbering for V regions according to the IMGT unique numbering.  Based on the hallmarks sites located on FR2 sequence, Vtoolkit destinguish the HCAbs from conventional antibodis automaticlly.


## Functions



## How vtools works



## Usage

#### Get variable region from protein sequences

```shell
# Usage: 
python python/vtoolkit.py \
  test/aa.fa \
  test/result.csv 

```

### Camel antibody classification: seperate heavy antibods from conventional antibodies
